title: Kareina's blog

This will become my blog. Today, 2025-12-01 I followed the instructions at https://dev.to/defenderofbasic/host-your-obsidian-notebook-on-github-pages-for-free-8l1 as far as "forking" their template, creating a new GitHub repository from it for my blog, and using GitHub Desktop to clone it to the computer. Now I have opened it in Obsidian, and can edit it here. In theory, this gets pushed back to GitHub when I push sync, and, after a bit of thinking time, it will show up on my blog at https://riiac.github.io/Kareinas-blog/.  Tomorrow, or at least another day, I can bring over my data from my actual Obsidian blogs vault and learn to customise it.,

Ok, I couldn't wait till tomorrow, first I copied over one file, [[2025-12-01 snow and further progress]], just to see what happens. When that worked, I copied over a full folder worth of old blog posts...
