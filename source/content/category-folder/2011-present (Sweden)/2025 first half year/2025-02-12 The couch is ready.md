Today as I finished up work I got a phone call.  The voice on the other end, speaking English, with a Swedish accent (which is kinda unusual as most Swedes speak perfect English but totally recognisable in those few *who don't) gave their name and then said "I am calling from the Trump Administration, we need someone for the Cabinet with half a brain, is that something you could see yourself as doing?"* I said "*no thank you!*" and he laughed, identified himself again, and said that our couch is ready for delivery.

We will wait till next week though as we want to finish the painting on the ceiling before it arrives.
