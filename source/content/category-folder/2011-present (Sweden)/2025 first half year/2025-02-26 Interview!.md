I have been called to an interview on Monday with the Umeå University Archaeology department for the one-year project assistant position working with digitalizing microfossil and fossil data into the SweDigArch infrastructure. https://swedigarch.se/

It was one of my colleagues here in the research data support team at the library who suggested that I apply, her husband runs one of the labs in Archaeology, and my current boss encouraged me to go for it, even if it might mean ending my current contract a little early to start the next job.
