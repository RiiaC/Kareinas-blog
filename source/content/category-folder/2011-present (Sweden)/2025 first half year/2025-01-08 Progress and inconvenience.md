Rearranging furniture on the weekend triggered more changes. I have never liked the couches that came with the house,  but it was easier to use than than be rid of them. Now that I am working I decided to through money at the problem,  and spent a couple of days filling in spreadsheets of what is available here in the way of a recliner corner couch. This also involved making scale models of modular recliner couch components to see how the various styles fit our living room.

Armed with this information I took the bus in town yesterday and met Keldor at the one furniture store that carries what I thought I wanted so we could test sit and recline. They are as wonderful as I thought they would be, and the salesman was delightful company chatting with us about my research and many other things unrelated to recliners, while aslo answering my questions and singing the praises of the [couch I wanted](https://hagagruppen.se/produkt/cinema/), but more in the "singing to the choir" and not "pushing a sale" sort of way. He was impressed with the level of research I had already done. 

When it was time to pay I asked him if he has a discount available for entertaining customers, and he gave me one big enough to feel nice. It will take at least a week before they are delivered, and could takke quite a few. So now we are valking about painting the living room ceiling before it is delivered. We bought midnight blue paint ages ago to cover the smoke marks on the ceiling from the previous owner, and we want to paint stars on that, as one does.

We are also making good progress on refinishing the dresser/desk.

However, this morning I woke with the same sort of "something wrong" with my hip as I had last year, so I have been trying to be careful with it. We spent a half an hour before work shoveling deep, light, fluffy, snow out of the way (very carefully on my part). When Keldor was nearly to work he stopped to help push a car that had gotten stuck in the snow, and when it started moving he moved wrong and messed up something in his back and/or hip, so he wound up leaving work early.

I worked in the office today, as I had a meeting with my bos. He is going to have the people in the customer service side of the library train me to do stuff for them, as we don't have thst much researc daya work just now (directly after the holidays). He says that this is good, because there may be another job advertised in the spring that I could transition to when my contract ends, and the extra experience would help.

Then I did some archive work, and when I finished the box Anders said tgat he wouldn't have time to get me another for today, so I caught an earlier bus than normal. If all had gone normally, I would have been home around 15:00. However, four minutes from home the bus stopped. Parked cars as far ahead as we could see. I contemplated walking, but Google said 1.5 hours walk home from there, and that wouldn't be kind to my hip, nor my shoulders carrying the computer and the backpack. So I waited.

Keldor, who had driven to the busstop to pick me up (I didn't ask him too, but it was sweet) waited. 1.5 hous later, we finally started moving! I feel like I should have walked, but my hip and shoulders are glad I didn't. Alas, I don't have enough work to do to work from home tomorrow,  so I have to get back on that bus...
