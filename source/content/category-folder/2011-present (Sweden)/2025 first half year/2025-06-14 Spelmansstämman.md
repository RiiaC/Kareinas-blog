This is my first Spelmansstämman in several years. The year I moved to Lövånger, I still made it back for the event and performed with my folk dance group, as we had been practicing together all winter, and I was still working some days each month in Luleå, which meant I got in some occasional practice with them.

But then Keldor and I spent a couple summers traveling to lots of SCA events, and weren't home on the correct weekend to take the trip up for it, and I missed it, though I also had ever so much fun with the things we did instead. 

Then I got to talking with Tania, and we agreed that this was finally the year she would make the visit to Sweden, and we choose Spelmansstämman, as the timing was perfect, falling on a weekend they didn't have any performances scheduled.

They were scheduled to arrive on Thursday  and stay for a week. Since we would be attending Spelmansstämman, I contacted my old folk and they said I could join them for the performance. 

On Tuesday Mike came down with Covid, and they had to cancel the trip. This made us all sad, and I felt sorry for Mike, who was also sick. Tania managed to re-book the flights to visit between Cudgel War and when we leave for Lofoten, abd I look forward to that.

But, since they weren't coming this week, I moved those vacation days to when they are actually going to be here, and worked on Friday, getting in some good progress on the tutorial video for filtering and exporting data from the database. 

Keldor suggested Friday morning that I pick him up after work  and we could head north from there. His eork day ends at 15:00, which would mean my leaving at 14:30. But it turned out to be one of those days when they were waiting for parts, which clearly wouldn't be delivered on time, so he quit early and just came home, which meant I could work right up to 14:30, after which I baked some naan bread to take with us, it being fast, and travels well.

That plus packing took longer than I wanted, so we started driving just after 16:00. I expected us to be late to the concert, but we made good time, and arrived to Gammelstad at 18:05, pulling into the parking lot at the same as Barbara, so Kelsor was able to give her the directly the package we pucked up at Double Wars, and he recieved a bag of Robinie wood from a tree her dad had cut down. He will, of course, make knife handels of it.

The consert opened with a group of students (I think) Who played a number of lovely pieces, and then Nina Nordvall, who is described as a "Jojkare, accordeonist, kompositör & artist" on the program.  I really enjoyed both, and I sent Tania short films from each performance, since they couldn't be there.

Then we went to the dance, and I danced till 23:00, and had so much fun! Then we headed back to David's to sleep (but had to wait for him to get home, as Caroline was already asleep and had locked the door, luckily, he was only a couple of minutes behind us)

Saturday I put on my folk costume and we returned to Spelmansstämman and I participated in the march from the church to the stage. Ellinor was there, also in her folk costume, so she waited with me for the start of the parade, and walked with me. It was good to catch up. I hadn't heard that she had split up with he child's father, and I hope that it goes well for her going forward. 

I watched a number of performances, sending short video clips to Tania as they went, and attended the folk song workshop, which is always fun. Keldor filmed our dance performance as a single 15 minute film, so I couldn't send it to Tania, the file was too big. I should do something about that. Perhaps if I put it on the computer, open it in Lightworks, and break it into individual dances, I can save each one.
