Since Cudgel was so rainy I was a little concerned about getting the tent dry after.  No problem,  it has been hot and sunny since we got home.  Not only did the tent dry, but we have even waterproofed the sunshade, which hasn't been so rain-proof.

Tomorrow, when it has dried from that we can put them both away.

Today Keldor built another screen window, so now the house is finally cooling.
