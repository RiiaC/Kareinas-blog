Today, just before my 10 am meeting, I got a message from Keldor saying he was fine, but had totalled the work car, and he would give me details later. 

It was almost 2.5 hours later before I got the details. Turning right, oncoming traffic he kept an eye on to avoid hitting.  The car suddenly stopped,  hard, against a low concrete barrier he hadn't seen. 

Result? Front right tire crunched, and pushed to the back of its wheel well, and some scrapes along the adjacent door panel. He had a headache (which could have come from working in a gas mask all morning), and a tender area on the chest where the seat belt held him in place.

After speaking with him I took my elsparkcyckel (electric scooter) out with the plan of heading in to town to run errands. While passing the next building, on the stretch where the pavement is a bunch of small concrete tiles that cause a constant thump-thump-thump sound while rolling over them, I noticed that my rear view mirror wasn't in the best alignment, so I lifted my left hand off the handlebar to adjust it. In hindsight   I should have come to a comlete stop first.

I hadn't been going very fast, but shifting that hand corresponded with the elsparkcyckel abruptly laying itself down on its side, which, since I had bern standing on it, and was still holding the right hand handlebar, meant that I also wound up on the pavement,  landing on my right hip/upper thigh, and right elbow.

I hopped up directly, and my colleague, who had seen me fall, hurried over to ask if I was alright. I told him I was pretty certain there would be brusing, but I appeared to be fine. He was relieved to hear that. The mirror on the trike, however, was no longer attached. 

Having also lost all motivation to run errands, I hopped back on the trike, holding the mirror in one hand, in addition to holding the handlebar, and returned to my office. 

After removing my helmet and wrist protection (neither of which made contact with the ground, I think),  and my, undamaged long sleeved over shirt I could see that there was a scrape on my elbow.

So I grabbed my office bottle of chlorhexidine, the roll of medical tape, and the tube of healing salve, and went to the loo. There I washed and disinfected the scrape, put on the salce, and tape over it. Then I looked at my hip. No scrapes or visible bruising.  Lots of "gee, that hurts, and must be a substantial invisible bruise".

So then I went up to the lunch room, where I looked in the freezer, found a small ice tray, emptied it into a plastic bag, refilled it and put the tray back into the freezer, then returned to my office and carefully sat down to the computer,  neteling my bag of ice against the tender bits. 

I got in an hour or so of work till it was time to catch the bus home. I decided not to bring the elsparkcyckel with me, as I didn't want to wrestle it into the cargo cabinet,  nor do I want to ride without the mirror.

So I just unscrewed the part that was still attached to the handle, and took it, along with the stem and mirror, home with me, where Keldor glued them back together. 

Now it is bed time, and I don't want to lay down on my right side, which is a shame, aa that is the side I normally start on.
