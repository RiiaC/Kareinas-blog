I have been making progress on painting the ceiling, and now the delivery of the new couch is scheduled for next Friday,  so I really hope I am done with the ceiling by then (it looks like a very doable goal). I really like how adding the stars seems to make the circles and arcs turn into a dome. I hope the effect continues to work when I get them all in.

On Thursday we had fighter practice for the shire  for the first time in ages. I worked from home, and caught the bus that gets to town at 17:40.  Keldor was working on a helm for a friend in the shop at work, so I told him I would call when the bus was 15 from the stop so he could meet me. However, even though he knew I was coming from home, his mind was thinking I was coming from work, and so he was convinced that he had 1.5 hours more project time, not 20 minutes more. As a result he needed to pack stuff away, and didn't get out the door till after I started walking to the school. It is a 15 minute walk, and I had come to the place where the bike path ducks under a road just before the school, and from there on is not accessible by car, just as he crossed the road I was about to walk under. So he had just enough time to unload the armour to the porch by the gym door and start driving to the parking area in the time it took me to walk around the building. 

It was, unsurprisingly, only he, I, and Gilbert at practice. We really need to advertise it to the wider community,  but it was good to put on the armour and see what still needs to change to be really comfortable,  and we all worked hard enough to sweat.
