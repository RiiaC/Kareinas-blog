During the work day I am working, which, right now, means learning as much as I can about SweDigArch and SEAD, and all the rest of our time is getting ready for Double Wars. We leave tomorrow. 

Most projects needing doing have been done. Most things are packed and ready to go in the car. 

I am feeling accomplished on both fronts, and am going to post this now, as empty of actual content as it is, and get back to packing.
