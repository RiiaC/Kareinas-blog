Today I finally got the reviewer comments to the paper I submitted in early September. Both reviewers were complimentary to the new approach I have developed and that it is worth publishing. They both had good suggestions for minor changes.

The editors comments included "*Because we are trying to facilitate timely publication of manuscripts submitted to Archaeometry, your revised manuscript should be uploaded as soon as possible.  If it is not possible for you to submit your revision in a reasonable amount of time, we may have to consider your paper as a new submission*".

I have just replied to the editor "*Thank you very much for this good news. The suggested changes are, indeed, minor, and I should be able to get the manuscript back to you quite soon. I have nearly made all of the edits already. However, fixing the figures (e.g. spelling of Klungen in the figure text) will take more time, so that will have to wait until tomorrow.*"  I did NOT include the sentence "*thank you for extending to me the same patience with this delay as I extended to you while awaiting the reviewer's comments"*. I did, however, think it pretty loudly in their general direction.
