Since I worked from home today, I was able to mend Keldor’s thick sweater as he drove to work this morning. The call wasn't long enough to get all of the holes darned, so I opened the [Marcy Rockman Inspirational Lecture from Swedigarch web page](https://swedigarch.se/index.php/2024/02/07/marcy-rockman-inspirational-lecture-video/), and listened to that as I kept mending. The talk was just long enough to get the Sweater fully mended, and then I sat to the computer to work, taking the time to reach out to Marcy to say:
> I just wanted to let you know that I just went back and listened to your Swedigarch Inspirational lecture from last winter and really enjoyed it. It was an exceptionally well prepared,  presented, and interesting talk. Thank you for making it.
>That I already knew from more recent Sedigarch news announcements that you moved to Sweden some months after doing that talk because your research topics are now discouraged in the States made the talk even more powerful. 

Marcy replied later that day with thanks, and saying it was nice to meet us when she visited our uni. She's looking forward to collaborating with us. Somehow, I seemed to have learned to do networking. 

As my work day was winding to a close, I thought of the Sead data structure Obsidian vault I made so that I could look at the database in the cool Obsidian graphs, and how I want to use it as a tool for data mapping, and inspiration hit.

First I went in to the extra folder I had added with the intent to use it for mapping the radiocarbon data set to SEAD's structure.  This time, since I have been working on filling in the spreadsheet we use to do the input, I was able to start filling in instructions on how to do what I have already done with [the Site information in the spreadsheet](https://riiac.github.io/SEAD_structure_Obsidian/catagory-folder/Radiocarbon-Data-mapping/D.-Site) and with the information on [references associated with those sites](https://riiac.github.io/SEAD_structure_Obsidian/catagory-folder/Radiocarbon-Data-mapping/O.-Source) once I did that I thought it would be fun to test and see how the vault translates to a web page.

I could have followed exactly the same steps as yesterday when doing the setup for my blog, but that results in two different vaults, one that gets turned into a blog, and the one that already existed before starting the project. Therefore, instead of "forking" the Quartz GitHub package and then adding my Obsidian vault folders to it, I decided to try the reverse process, just copy the non-data folders from the personal blog Quartz package directly into the Obsidian folders for the SEAD structure vault. [This worked](https://riiac.github.io/SEAD_structure_Obsidian/), but not directly. First I had some error messages to deal with, so I called in Copilot to help. It took some time, but we resolved the problem, and I learned a lot in the process. If the folder you need is called source in the Quartz package, don't name it Source, GitHub will throw error messages at you till you fix it.

In other news, the cats are seriously cute. They came and helped me work, one at a time, on and off all day. Once I finally got up from the computer to do my evening yoga they both came and took my chair.

Alas, i still don't have my blog set up to push to GitHub from my phone, which means that the Dreamwidth copy of this post won't get the photo of the cats till after I get to the computer.
