The plan for today as of last night had been "divide and  conquer". He would go i  to the workshop at work and make lists to hold the insulation to the ceiling,  while I stayed home and cut the insulation to fit the spaces in the wall. 

This morning Keldor decided that he's rather stay home today and stay after work one day this week to make the lists. Therefore, after a leisurely morning he went upstairs and started cutting insulation to fit, and I went to the kitchen to make a beetloaf.  While that was in the oven I started a batch of crackers, or kex as they are called in Swedish. 

Once all the baking was done I went upstairs and helped with the insulation.  Now both side walls have been covered most of the way up, and much of the outer wall too. It is starting to look like it will be a room.

If I don't hear from the plumber tomorrow with the estimate on the cost of putting a toilet and sink up here, and in the cellar,  i should poke them. While that part won't be done this year, we want them to do it in January. 

And we hope to have the insulation for the bedroom part done and covered with walls before our new years party, as it will be good extra crash space.
