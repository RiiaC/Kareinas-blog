We met in zoom, J, R, Þ, online, and Keldor and I here. We had tested the technology thecday before, and it worked great. This time there was No sound from the yoga app playing in the room, but the "shsre sound" was working, so the other three could hear the instructions. We discovered the problem too last minute to try to trouble shoot just then, so we lived with it.
The problem was when I removed my Bluetooth device that talks to my hearing aid the sound for the other apps was gone. The the yoga app continued to send the sound to the hearing aid, which couldn't receive it because the Bluetooth device was gone.
