Having gone to bed really early last night, I woke up before the 05:00 dawn light. Keldor is still sick, so I left him to sleep, and I did a half an hour of pilates before work.

I made pizza today after work yum! (Well, ok, the bread sponge had been set yesterday, and the dough made this morning before work.) We had no tomato paste, so I put a box of "krossade tomat", and some frozen kebab, spinach and kale in a pot with lots of herbs and spices, and a little mushroom powder and let them cook while the oven and pizza stones pre-heated. Then I added some drained canned artichoke hearts, and some chopped "kaffeost" (or, rather, what is sold as "kaffeost at our local Saluhall, but has a texture more like "grill cheese" than the proper Finnish "*leipäjuusto*"). I used this topping exactly as it was for my pizza, Keldor added slices of his normal cheese ("*prästost*") and some extra chili to his pizza. 

I also dried some mango today, using a potato peeler to make thin slices. One mango just fills a single tray, so the two I had bought filled only two trays, so I could have bought eight more, but I probably wouldn't have been willing to chop that many. Of course, before I could dry them, I needed to empty the apples from the dehydrator that had been sitting there a few days, and since I was at it, I even put away the mushrooms Keldor had dried with the old dehydrator.

Today we took down Keldor's old large screen TV, which quit working abruptly a few weeks ago, and put up instead the one we got from Torunn on Tuesday. He is very pleased to be able to play videos on that one again, and he fell asleep on the couch in front of it while I updated my finances at the computer.

Since I still haven't gotten my home computer switched over to Linux I have been accessing the few files I need through backup I made to my external hard drive, and just opening them with the work computer, and saving them back to the external drive.

I have been using Quicken to track my personal finances since I inherited my step dad's computer in 2003. If I upgrade my computer I am not going to be able to easily use that program anymore, in part because the new one won't have a CD drive. I can't use it on my work computer for that reason. However, I have gotten used to using GnuCash for tracking shire expenses, so I decided a week or so ago to try it for my personal expenses, too, and I exported my Quicken files, and then imported them into GnuCash. It worked, but the result is very, very messy, as I have been using lots and lots and lots of different categories in Quicken, all of which become accounts in GnuCash. I made a half hearted attempt to clean it up on the day I tested this, by combining related expense accounts into single accounts, but it would have taken a very long time to make it manageable.

Therefore, I decided to just start over with a clean slate, and set up a new GnuCash file, entered in opening balances the amounts in my various accounts on 31 October, and then entered in the few transactions that have already happened this month. I even colour coded the various bank accounts, and set up the house bill accounts that will be needed. Each account has under "notes" the statement that for transactions before 2025-10-31 see either the quicken files, or the GnuCash file made from the export from Quicken.  I suppose that it would have made more sense to have the transition date be the first of the year, but I was not willing to do that much data entry, so I will live with this.

It makes me happy to have this data accessible again (I have not been using my own computer for ages, save for the occasional day I decided to update my finances, or use files I can't access on the work computer, the former of which didn't happen often enough). 

Tomorrow I should check the Reengarda finances. I should have done it tonight, but it is already nearly 22:00, so I should just do my yoga and get some sleep.
