I left my Swedish through literature and music class an hour early so I could get the 16:15 bus home so we could go see Bryan's new house that he bought today.

After looking through everything we sat and talked for quite a while before walking home. So nice to have a friend in walking distance!

He flyes back to Pennsylvania on Monday, and plans to move here next August after the kids head off to College. 

This means that if we need to stay somewhere else this winter when we are getting the plumbing done, we can syay there.
