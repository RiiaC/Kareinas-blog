Given how late we got home on Sunday Keldor sent his boss a note that he would be late for work,  so we set the alarm for 07:15 instead of 05:00, and I took the bus that leave here at 07:55 instead of 06:20. 

Keldor drove me to the bus stop, so I didn't need to carry Aeirn's helmet that I was to deliver her. Brother Suck was also at the bus stop, and we told him about the bookshelves we'd picked up the night before. He expressed interest, so we said he could have the two tall ones he he wants. Yes, he wants!

I got a little work done, and cleared out my inbox before time for Swedish class, which was fun. Then caught the 17:20 bus home. Keldor met me at the bus stop just before 19:00 and we took the bookshelves (which were still in the car) straight to Brother Suck.

Then home and relax a bit before doing yoga and getting some sleep.
