Zoom call with two of my sisters this morning (Amber was at the Opra, and couldn't make it). It was the first time in a while that we've manged to catch up, so that was nice. 

Then I went back to sleep for bit, played a game of Qwirkle with Keldor which was an unusually high point game. Some days neither of us break 200 points. Today I got 230 points, which was really low compared to his 276.

Then we went to town and bought the white Styrofoam like house insulation we need to make the attic bedroom, then continued on to Jonas' party celebrating both five years sover and 50 years of life. Good conversation, and games.

We played a variant of Carcassonne I hadn't seen before, that included a river, and commodities one can collect if you complete the right city. Fun!

Before we left for the evening we were admiring Anna's beautiful painted boxes, and I fell head over heels in love with this wonderful little critter, and, much to my surprise, she gave me the box!

Keldor got this one, which is nearly as cute:

Because I had gotten up early for the call I was super tired, and started getting ready for bed just before 21:00. Keldor emptied the litter box, took the bag out to the trash cab outside,  came in and told me to put on my shoes and come outside to see the Aurora. 

I did (plus coat, etc.), and we walked down to the edge of the nature reserve where the trees block the neighbourhood street and house lights and enjoyed one of the best display of Northern Lights I have seen. Woth staying up a little later than planned.
