I got on the bus this morning at the usual time, 06:20. Worked on the bus, as usual. Put in a full productive day, with meetings. Went to my Swedish literature and music class  caught the 17:22 bus home, feeling too tired to get out the computer, so I simply read from the novel we are reading for class (Jävla Karlar). I was in an uncomfortable bit of the chapter, and I was hoping to get to the chapter resolution before the bus got to Lövånger. 

Just as we were nearly there, at 18:34 (so more than 12 hours after leaving home) my phone rang, so instead of slowly and deliberate putting on my boots and coat and backpack, I attempted to speak to the nice little old lady who sold Bryan the house, who wondered if I could go in and get her two walkers that were still there so her son can pick them up on Saturday (we had talked yesterday about him coming by Saturday to pick up some unspecified stuff that was still there, and I said then we aren't home on Saturday, but would leave the house key in the mailbox for him to use  and then leave it there for us to get when we got home).

While we talked I saw the gas station, and quickly put on my boots, picked up my coat, hood, and sweater, and carried them to the door, thinking I could duck into the building to put them on (it is -13 C, so one wants them before walking 12 minutes home. But there was Keldor, in my car, there to pick me up, so I hopped in, still talking to the nice old lady, who said goobye.

I explained to him our mission, we drove home, got the key and started driving back to Bryan's new house. Then it struck me. My backpack. I never picked up my backpack, with my computer, it is still on the bus! Opps. Big Oops!

Keldor started driving towards the highway, I opened the buss app to see that it hadn't gotten very far yet. Perhaps four minutes ahead of us.

He drove, I kept an eye on bus progress. We gradually got closer. We caught up with a semi, doing the speed limit, in a place where passing isn't an option.

I looked up the phone number of the bus company customer service, got a human straight away, explained my problem, which bus I was chasing, where it was. She put me on hold, got in touch with the driver, who wasn't willing to stop and wait for us till he got to Skellefteå. We passed the semi, and caught up with the bus just as it stopped in Bureå to let someone out.

Keldor pulled in behind him, I hopped out and tried waving him down. He drove off, with my backpack. Asshole. 

I got back in the car. We passed him and drove to the bus station. The bus arrived, the door opened,  I boarded and said "Hej! Jag behöver bara min ryggsäck" he just looked at me with a very strange look. I went upstairs, got my backpack, and left the bus, saying "tack så mycket".

Since we were in town anyway, we went to the big grocery store, got some things we have been needing (after using the loo),  and then we filled the tank so we could make it home. 

Ok, I filled the tank. Keldor had left the house wearing sandals, as he was only heading the short distance to the bus stop, and had left the car running for a bit before departure so the car would be warm. He had no coat, hat or gloves either. One doesn't stand outside and pump gas in this weather without warm outer garments. 

Then we drove home, turning in to Lövånger just as the same bus, on its way to Umeå this time, pulled out of the busstop in front of us, such that we had to slow down to not hit it. Asshole. We don't know, but will forever assume, that it was the same driver.

Then we found the walkers in Bryan's shed and left them out for the old lady's son to pick up. Mission accomplished, more than an hour later than planned, and now it is well past bedtime, and I should do my yoga.
