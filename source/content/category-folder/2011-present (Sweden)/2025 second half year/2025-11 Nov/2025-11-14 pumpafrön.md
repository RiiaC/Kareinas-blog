I have always loved freshly roasted pumpkin seeds. As a child they were a once a year thing, when we bought the halloween pumpkin. Later I learned that pumpkin and squash are food, and that all the seeds in that family are yummy. So why was I today years old before I tried "roasting" them in a microwave? Two minutes from start to crunchy yummy little seeds from a butternut pumpkin, and I am very happy.
