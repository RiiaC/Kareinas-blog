As we got ready for bed, Keldor noticed the lights were out. It was just after midnight, so we walked down to the edge of the nature reserve and wayched  and took photos.
My camera kinda worked:

During work I saw an email from the new union representative for the department, who shared a link to SACO, the umbrella union that is made up of a variety of other unions, and I took the time to read through the list, and realized that years ago,  when I wasn't yet fluent in Swedish,  and had to pick a union to join, and saw the one with "akademiker" In its name, I clearly hadn't taken the time to traslate the list of careers it was aimed at "behavioral scientists, economists, public health scientists, human resources scientists, social scientists, sociologists and others in social work", if I ever saw such a list. 

So today I did a little poking around, and see that there is one called Sveriges universitetslärare och forskare, SULF, in other words, akademiker are not at universites, but SULF is only teachers and researchers. So now I have started the paperwork to switch.

After work we finished watching Bondånger, a Swedish show from the 1990's, which is a fascinating time capsule, and I made progress on a sewing project. 

Before bed I went back out to see if there were any northern lights out. Saw only a hint of them in the north, but the moon was beautiful, and so bright that my shadow was crisp and clear. I managed an interesting selfie with the moon above me, and the reflective trim of my hood showing, even a little glimpt of blue light reflected off my glasses.
