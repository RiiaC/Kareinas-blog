Work from home days are good for the cats. Kali convinced me to brush her three times before 07:30, which is a lot of fur that won't become hairballs.

At work today I finally finished working my way through the list sites from the Radiocarbon data, finding coordinates for most of them, and sent it off to the researcher to figure out if I got it right. It has taken many weeks to work through the list, so it feels good to get this done.

Baked more of the yummy butter almond cookies with raspberry-chilli jam.

We finally made time to get back to work on the attic bedroom. First time in three weeks! We put up more of the horizontal boards between the uprights, and started stapling tarpaper to them to form the outside of what will become insulated walls. It doesn't look like we can continue with it till next week, unless we have energy tomorrow after work (and it is a long day tomorrow, with my three hour Swedish class not starting till I have already put in a full day), since Thursday is fighter practice, and Friday we head to Sundsvall for the SCA event.
