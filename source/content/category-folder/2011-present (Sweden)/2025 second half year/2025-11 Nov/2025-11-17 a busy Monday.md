We had a light dusting of snow when I woke. Took the bus south to Umeå, where they have several cm of snow. Much prettier. 

Went to lunch with 3 PhD students, who were on their way past my office when I returned from the loo, and joining them sounded more fun than working. It was.

Then I managed a bit of work before my Swedish through music and literature class, which was fun.

Once home we went and locked Bryan's garage for him, now that the previous owner's son has taken the last of the things from the garage. He's off to Umeå for a night at a hotel before flying back to Philly. Come August if all goes well, his son will head to Uni in Japan, his daughter will head to Uni here in Sweden, and he will move here.

Before  locking the garage, we even put Keldor’s extra bicycles in Bryan's garage to get them out of the attic. The plan is to resume work on it tomorrow.
