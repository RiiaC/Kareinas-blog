I managed to work productively before lunch, but never made myself return to the computer after eating my artichoke, which was followed by a bowl of popcorn. Oops. Such low energy, but not sleepy,so didn't take a nap, just read. At least ot was the book i am reading for Swedish class, which I am now much further along than we should be for Monday. 

Since I wasn't working anyway, I convinced myself to take the bus into town for figheter practice, our first in months. Moving helped. Alas,towards the end of the session, while we were just using boffers I got hit in the wrist, on the hockey glove I was wearing, and it still hurt, so I quit for the day and took off my armour to see that it was already swolen. Sigh. Nothing appears broken, but the puffy area is likely to look bruised tomorrow. 

When we got home it was to a letter from the bank, which has finally approved our application for me to get access to the bank account. 

So tomorrow I need to go in with him in the morning and work at his dad's house a couple of hours. Then we will go to the bank for the final step of showing ID to get Internet access.
