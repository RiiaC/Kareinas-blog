Met my cousin Tristyn in FB Messenger, as he is about to take a trip to Europe. Virginia introduced us. Tristyn's mom is Jim's neice.
We started chatting, and he said:
"My college major is archaeology with a minor in museum curatorship!! I managed to land a study abroad scholarship while in my junior year of high school and so studied abroad in Rome Italy for a month, and fell in love with the atmosphere. I've always been a history nerd so being in Rome for a month and my trip to Pompeii helped me to figure my college major (archaeology + classics at The American University of Rome). So in Fall of 2026 I will be attending school there and for the next 3 weeks I'm visiting wherever I can as to not let my non-refundable plane tickets go to waste."

Keldor returned home after the 333 Swedish round trip to take Daniel and his stuff to Kiruna. 70 people donated to the cost of the trip! This means that Daniel has enough left over to live on till he gets his first paycheck. 

While he drove I did cleaning and rearranging of the attic, and started an inventory of what is up there.

I used his new skull cake pan to bake him an oven pancake. It looks like a light bulb...

I also took away the old under counter light in the kitchen, which is mo longer needed now that we have the longer led light strip. Now one can see the tools hanging by the wall!
