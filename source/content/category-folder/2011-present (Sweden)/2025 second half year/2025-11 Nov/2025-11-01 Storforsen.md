We went up the lighthouse at Jävre on the way there

Clara liked Storforsen as much as I expected she would.

When we got home I made a big batch of naanbröd, and then made a gryta for the guys, who were nearing home.

Keldor and Daniel arrived as food was ready. Then we played Unstable Unicorns. Clara won.
