Marcus from BVS Rör came by in the morning and we discussed my dream of a toalett and sink in the attic and another in the basement. He will send a cost estimate later, but suggested doing first the one and then the orher.

Since I worked from home I took the opportunity to wash the bed sheets. Yay! Clean sheets!

After work took bows and arrows in for the first indoor archery practice of the season.  Stidd shoulders meant I had problems turning my head to shoot, so I did yoga and came home early. 

This meant that I was home just early enough to stop by the store and pick up some vegetables and cook a green sauce to go with the spagetti squash I had roastedwhile working. Alas, when I tried standing up the immersion blender in the pot while I reached for the rubber spatula to scrape the side of the pot, the blender slipped, fell out of the pot splashing thich, boiling hot green sauce on me, the stove, the walls... oops.

I ran cold water on my arms, cleaned everything up, and finished cooking. Then I grated the butternut pumpkin and put it in the dehydrator so we will can toss a little into soups and stews.

Keldor got home around then, and built a fire in the heater, since it wasn't warming the water with just electricity so we will be able to take a got shower before bed.

Then he added a reinforcement board to the side of the bed. The frame had cracked when we were in Norway, and the cat sitter had glued it and clamped it together. It held till last night, when we heard a crack as Keldor was getting out of bed to head to the loo in the middle of the night, but we opted to keep sleeping and ignore it.

This morning we looked at the crack, and decided we would deal with it in stages. Stage 1, glue and screw on a reinforcement board. When we take the bed apart tomove to the upstairs room we can replace that board. I promptly forgot about it, but he remembered, so now stage 1 is done.
