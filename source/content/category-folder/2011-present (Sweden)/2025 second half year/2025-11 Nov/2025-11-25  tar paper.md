Worked from home today as I had a 07:00 meeting with a colleague in Australia to discuss recommend database structure for LA-ICP-MS data, and I didn't want to do that on the bus.

I did a quick 20 minutes HIT during the day as I was waiting for files to be copied from my old computer to the external hard drive.

After work Keldor let me know that he has had a brilliant plan, we will use pandemic technology to encourage he and some of our friends to add a little movement into their lives by having a zoom meeting two or three times a week to do yoga and training with me (and my DownDog app). (Of course I said yes, to the suggestion he knew I would.) We will meet at 21:00 Swedish time zone,  on Monday, Wednesday and Friday on even number weeks and Tuesday, Thursday on odd number weeks. Tomorrow is our first session. If you want to join us let me know and I will share the link.

Then we did an hour of work putting up more tar paper in preparation for insulating the attic room.
