Got up early, plugged in the car to defrost the windows, and gathered food and sewing project, and started driving towards Umeå to meet Tristyn's train. When we left the train was showing on time, with expected arrival at 07:05. We reaced the station at 06:51. But, there is something wrong with the track, so it is delayed. So we did the shopping we planned to do after, and I updated this and worked on sewing. 

I managed to get the pocket on my sweater alteration project pinned into place before Tristyn arrived, so I was able to finish it as we drove home.

Tristyn is a delightful young man, and good company. He hadn't heard of the SCA, and seems interested. 

We took him to the Virya's house warming party, which was fun.
