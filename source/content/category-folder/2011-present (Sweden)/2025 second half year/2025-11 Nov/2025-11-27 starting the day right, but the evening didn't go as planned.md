Woke at 04:10 and did 25 minutes of pilates before his 05:00 alarm went off. 

Worked, went to the busstop to take the bus to town for archery practice.  The bus was more than 10 minutes late, presumably due to bad roads, as the temperature had warmed up to just above freezing today, rained, and then started cooling down again.

I chatted with Keldor on the phone while I waited. He was driving towards Bureå, where I would get off the buss, meet him, and we would head back to Skelleftåhamn for Archery practice. 

The bus finally arrived just after 16:00, a single story bus (I prefer the two story variant I normally take two work--nicer view from upstairs). I boarded  took a seat near the back door (in the middle of the bus, and got my coat and boots off, myself settled, my seat belt on, took out my sewing, and then the bus lurched a bit as the driver tried to stop, there was a bump and a loud noise as we hit something  and two more loud impact noises and bumps before the bus finally came to a stop (plus many noises from the humans in the buss expressing various levels of fear and surprise).

None of the bumps nor the stopping were enough to damage any of us on the bus, not even those who weren't wearing seat belts. 

The car that was directly outside my window, however, was in pretty bad shape, missing the front end of its hood.

As soon as the driver assured themselves that none of the passengers were hurt, he encouraged everyone to move over to the left side of the bus. We had come to a stop near enough the edge of the road, and the back tires just off the road edge that the bus had a gentle lean to the right.

The driver asked us not to leave the bus, as he didn't want to risk that it migt fall over and crush us. We thought this an excellent reason to stay put, and we who had empty seats next to us on the right invited people to come sit next to us. I did, however put my boots on first, so that when it becomes safe to leave, I could do so directly. 

Given that I was going no where any time soon we decided that instead of going to Archery practice Keldor would drive towards me, and as soon as we could leave the bus I would walk over to where he could park and wait for me, and we would head home.

As he drove, slowly, down the road towards me, he reported each time police, ambulance and tow trucks drove past him towards us, and when each came into my sight I let him know. 

The accident took place just past the [Broänge bus stop, at the intersection of the smaller road towards Mångbyn and Hökmark](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aeCChF8mP5pdkiDt9),  so Keldor left the Highway at Hökmark and took the small road till he could see us.

Meanwhile, I was watching the people tending to the driver of the munched car directly out my window, who remained in the car for quite some time, and I was very concerned for them. So when the driver eventually got out of the car and walked on their own legs (with people on either side, just in case), I was very relived. They looked very shaken (no way they weren't in shock), but being able to walk after losing the front end of a car to a bus is a very good sign.

After the driver was taken away their car was pulled off to the side of the road. Well, draged, neither of the tires on the side towards me rotated.

I didn't see what happend to the other car, (cars?) But one wound up in the field on the far side of the bus out of my field of view. I hope that everyone in them is ok.

Shortly after the accident I heard the person behind me talking on the phone to someone say that they would be late  why, and that their phone battery was nearly flat. At which point I noticed that bus interior lights were still on, so I got out my charger, plugged it into the outlet in front of me, checked to see that it charges a phone, then offered it to the person behing me, who was grateful. After a time their phone had enough,  so we passed the cable to the person in front of me, who also needed to charge a phone, so I was useful as we waited. 

Eventually the road was clear enough of car wreckage that the police started letting the queue of cars behind us drive past so that the new bus, which had been sent to take the passengers further, would be able to get to us.

When an police officer boarded, around 17:30, the bus to let us know our bus would soon arrive, I asked if I could leave now, as my partner was in a car on the other side of the road, ready to take me home. 

Yes, if I wait to cross the street till an officer stops traffic again. Yes, yes I will! 

A few minutes later I was home again, where I beat him in a game of Qwirkle, spread more of the coarse saw dust in the attic outside of where the bedroom will be, and watched an archaeology documentary.
