Having gone to sleep early, I woke nearly eight hours later, at 05:42 with that vauge discomfort in my hips that will turn into an ache if I don't move them, so I got up, took the sheepskins to the feast hall and did a 30 minutes pilates session. 

After that I was still the only one on site awake, so I tried going back to sleep. When that  didn't work I updated my logs till people started stiring.

Then up, breakfast and chat with people, pack and load the car, help clean and pack the site a little, then start home, stopping first at a local runestone, with bonus 12th Century church ruins. [Selångerstenen, M10, L1935:4629, Selånger 86:2](https://kvikr.se/finn/php/finn-click.php?id=runkartan&target=https%3A%2F%2Frunkartan.se%2Frunristningar%2Frunsten-selangerstenen-m10-l1935-4629-selanger-86-2-i-sundsvall-vasternorrland.html), then at a second had store, where Keldor bought colapsable pennant pole, and a smithy tong, and Keldor and Þórólfr both bought wooden scroll cases. 

When we got as far as Lövånger they dropped me and our stuff off, and while Keldor drove Þórólfr home to Skelleftåhamn I put away everything we had taken to the event, getting the last of it done just before he came back for me.

Then we drove back south to Umeå for a memorial ficka in honor of Ingemar, which was a lovely social time. At the end of the evening several of us went over to "Skroten", one of the places Ingemar had stuff in storage. That building is scheduled to be demolished soon, and the other guy who had stuff there is frantically emptying it. He had book shelves to get rid of so we took three--two tall ones, and a really big collapsible one with solid wooden shelves.

We didn't get home till well after 22:00, and then yoga, so we didn't get to sleep till 22:30
