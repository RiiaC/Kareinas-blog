This could be considered an odd event for me to attend, given that I am never hungry in the evenings, and so don'teat the feast The focus is food, and the only scheduled activities are workshops to make food to be served at the feast, which isn't to be served until 18:00 at the earliest. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the day, with a morning of breakfast, sewing and chatting with people. Then I started helping Þórólfr cut out a new tunic from a pale lilac coloured wool.  

Just after we got the body rectangle and neck hole cut lunch was served, so we took a break to eat, the put the body on him. Marked the waist and underarm points, and measured how wide to make the side rectangles, and how long the sleeves will need to be.

Then it was a simple matter to cut the side rectangles, sleeves and four triangles to put between the intersection of the body and side rectangles. Now he has a new tunic, some assembly required. 

Soon after the tunic was cut he went to prepare for Court  as her Majesty's herald, and I resumed sewing and chatting. Court was short and sweet, with a few well deserving people getting awards. 

After court I switched to nålbindning https://trello.com/c/Ki2zfhTY, as I knew the feast hall would be lit by candlelight. I started a new psir of blue nålbinded short socks for me of a thick yarn. 

This time I decided to start from the ankel and work down. I used whatever the variation of Finnish stitch where you have only one loop around the thumb at a time, but take the needle through both it and the previous loop, from front to back, twist them and pass the needle through what will become the new thumb loop. 

I did this stitch all away atound the first pass around the ankle, working one sock left handed till it was long enough to fit, then did the other sock right handed to the same point, so I could be certain they were the same length. 

I even picked out the first couple of stitches  which are always a little wonky compared to the rest of the row,  and tightened the beginning to a nice looking taper.

When I was happy with both starting rows, they were the correct length to fit me  and they were the same (other than working direction), I started spiraling, but for this second row I switched to grabbing only the loop from the thumb for the twist, which makes for a more open texture pattern that I think will look nice as a pattern change.

After that row had come all the way back to the starting point I switched back to the first stitch, as the denser pattern will be better for the socks themselves. 
By  around 21:00 I had gotten the third row of both socks to the point where it opens up to leave room to later attach the heel spiral, taken one of them long enough to start attaching that row to the far side of the foot, and on the other sock about half of the distance before attaching it to the far side of the foot.

From here the plan is:

- [ ] Spiral down to the toes, decreasing diameter as needed to fit
- [ ] fill in the heels with spirals, possibly the opposite direction 
- [ ] look up which yarn I am using and update Trello cards
- [ ] take photos 

I put the project down because Keldor decided he was tired and was going to bed early. He said I could stay up longer, but this sounded like a good idea, so I was in bed by 21:40 and went straight to sleep.
