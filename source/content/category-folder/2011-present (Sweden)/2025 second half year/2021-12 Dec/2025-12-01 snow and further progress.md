We woke up today sto the first real snowfall of the year. I am so not counting the ~2cm we had that completely melted away this weekend. Still only about 10 or 12 cm, but much nicer. It was a little on the heavy side, since the temperature was only barely freezing, but I was still able to completely shovel both the parking area in front of the house and the driveway down to the garage in the time it took Keldor to drive to work. To be fair, that took him longer than normal (44 minutes today, instead of 35), as the highway hadn't been ploughed yet. It would be lovely if the snow would survive and we have a proper white winter, but the forecast is still predicting temps that aren't good for snow. I miss real winter. 

Today Keldor made some lists to hold the insulation sheets to the attic roof, and they work very well. We put up the first four, and now that he knows they will work, he will make the other type to hold the upper end of the next row down.
