Despite being up till 01:30 last night, I still got up with Keldor at 05:15 and kept him company on the phone as he drove to work. I love having a friend/partner I can talk with for hours every day, and still want to do it again tomorrow. 

I worked, productively, till lunchtime, and then quit for the day, still +3 hours for the month. Keldor was also done early, so we had lunch together, playing a game of Qwirkle as we ate.

Then we headed out, first to Robertsfors, about a half an hour south  where a package he had ordered was delivered. Then in to Umeå, where we dropped off those boxes of books I had packed up almost two week ago at my office, running into Anne, the new postdoc I met this week. I told her about the SCA, and she wants to learn to sew  so I need to remember to send her info.
Then we drove over to Torunn, who had set aside a set of reindeer antlers for us, arriving just as she was about to go take a load of stuff to donate to a second had store. As we drove I saw a car about to leave a school parking lot, and wondered "is that Drake?"

It was, and he drove to the same second hand store as we did, so while Torunn dripped off stuff we three walked through the store. Drake bought a knee board to convert into a shield, Keldor and I bought a long strip of lightning to brighten the attic, a soft sided cat carrier that is larger than the ones we have now, so they will both fit more comfortably, a couple more blue glass bowls (really, I can quit buying blue glass bowls any time I want), and a vlack long sleeved shirt for me. Torrun bought nothing, she is still trying to get rid of her late partner's stuff.

We also ran into another SCA person, whose name escapes me at the moment, who was buying Christmas decorations to fix up and make even more festive. At this news Torunn offered her a plastic Christmas tree, and got a Yes! So we said goodbye to Drake and went to one of Ingemar's storage places (there are several, there is a reason he's been gone nearly 2 years, and she's still working att reducing the amout of his stuff), and then another. She took the Christmas tree, and I wound up with a good umbrella,  a bag of hangers, a fur coat (had been his mother's, and much too small across the shoulders for Torunn), and a picknick basket. 

We gung our chatting till 20:00, and then went home, put everything away, washed the lining of the new cat carrier, played another game of Qwirkle (I lost this time), and cleaned the guest room and made the bed in prep for Clara's arrival from Pennsylvania tomorrow.

Now I have done my yoga, and it is once again 01:30, so I had better go get some sleep.
