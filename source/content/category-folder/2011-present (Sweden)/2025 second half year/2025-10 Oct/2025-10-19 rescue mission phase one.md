I woke at 07:30, did a 5 minutes pilates session as my hips were aching, and went to breakfast. Then I returned to the cabin, where the others were stiring, and I started packing and sent Keldor to go get his morning coffee. 

After she had eaten and packed her backpack Clara offered to help me load the car, but I told her that her most important mission was to go exchange contract details with the people she would like to keep in touch with. She saw the wisdom in this and went up to the hall.

Keldor finished his coffee on time to help me finish loading the car, and then we did our good by round of hugs.

We hit the road around 09:35, and reached Göteborg around 11:30. Keldor dropped us off at Aleydis' place and took Daniel to his apartment, where they loaded up the car with a good chunk of Daniel's things.

He has just accepted a job in Kiruna, but, having been without work as he studied, and since he finished the degree,  he doesn't have the budget for a move. So taking as much as reasonably fits with us now reduces the cost of the next trip. Soon, possibly next weekend, Zake and Keldor will drive sourh and pick up Daniel and the rest of his stuff.

While the guys were off loading the car we hung out with Aleydis, who explaoned that they've been cleaning out and getting rid of stuff, and what size are you? Want some garb? She then went and got s plastic tub full of her daughter's old garb, and a few of her own old costumes, most of which fits Clara perfectly, and a couple of things fits me and are in colours I wear. So we filled a large bag of wonderful costumes to take home, feeling grateful for her kindness, while Aleydis was happy to have so much stuff not only gone, but gone to someone who would use it.

Then Keldor came back for us, and after a short visit on the side of the road outside Aleydis' we hit the road jusy before 13:00.

On the way to Vadstena we stopped at Braehus, Rök runestone, and at the church nearest Vadstena with runestones built into the walls.

At Vadstena Keldor took a nap, I did yoga and took a nap, and Clara happily made herself a box of Mac and Cheese. Keldor woke just as Rebeccah and Petter were going to have dinner, so he joined them for the meal and we all enjoyed pleasant conversation. 

Then we got back on the road just before 20:00 and drove into the night.
