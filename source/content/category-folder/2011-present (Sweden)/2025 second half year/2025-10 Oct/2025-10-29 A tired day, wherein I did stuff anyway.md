This morning I was so tired I didn't manage to get up with Keldor and walk out the the car with him,  like I usually do. I did, however, manage to do the normal morning phone call as he drove, but it took a fair bit into the call to wake enough to actually open my eyes.

I worked a few hours, took a nap, and then worked long enough it was still a full day. Keldor worked a long day to finish the job he was working on so he could take tomorrow off. He will head south tomorrow to pick up Daniel and his things in Göteborg and bring him to his new job in Kiruna. There were 70 of us who donated amounts ranging from token to substantial, so the cost of the move is well covered, and he will be able to afford groceries and settling in costs before his first paycheck arrives.

This evening I make progress on altering the sweater I bought in Vadstena on our way to Boar Hunt, then did my yoga, and a little acroyoga.
