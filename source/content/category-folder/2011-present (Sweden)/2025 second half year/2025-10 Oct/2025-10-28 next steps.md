created my first GitHub repositories today, and filled them with four of my Obsidian vaults (this one, my main work one, the SEAD structure one, and Reengarda's inventory). Perhaps later I will learn how to make web page from this one, which would ne nice, as then I could include photos. But until I get a plugin pushing ths to Github, I will need to remember to do it manually. 

The contractor wrote back, he thinks my preferred location for the attic loo should work, and he will talk with the plumber and get back to me with an estimate. He can't do the work till January at the earliest. 

After work Clara slaughtered us in Qwirkle, and then we did the next few steps on the knife handels in progress. Hers has all the pieces glued and the rough form cut out. Mine has all the pieces glued and clamped so the glue will harden.
