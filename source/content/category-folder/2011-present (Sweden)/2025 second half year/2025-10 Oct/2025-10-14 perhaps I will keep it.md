Long day at work, as always on a Tuesday, with our weekly meeting not starting rill 15:00, which is my otherwise normal end time for the day. 

I was too tired to work on the bus home, so I only worked 9.5 hours, instead of 11.

After work:
Copied from what I posted today to FB:

I bought a computer last week. Wound up bringing home a touch screen, which is lovely when I have the computer in my lap. However, I just tried plugging it in to my nice large, and fairly new second monitor, and the Wacom tablet so I can interact with programs on the larger screen, and the tablet drivers refused to install, saying "platform not supported". Now I wonder if I should return the computer? I am NOT willing to learn to use a mouse after 30 years of using a pen and tablet to interact with a computer.

Is the problem that the computer is Windows? Does Linux support touch screen computers, and permit one to also use the Wacom pen and tablet?

An hour or three later, I added:

Edited to say, thanks David Granberg, you were able to help when Wacom's tech support couldn't. The problem turns out the wrong sort of processor to be able to use with a driver for a wacom pen tablet as old as the one I have been using for years. However, the wacom driver that does works with the processor on this computer drives the much newer wacom tablet from my work computer, so perhaps I will kerp the computer. The jury is still out as to weather I will keep Windows on it...
