Had breakfast with King Krake, who charged us with encouraging everyone at Boar Hunt to send recommendations for the Order of the Mark. 

Then off to Anundshög and stone ships, because Clara hadn't seen them yet, and they are always worth a visit.

From there we went off to see the rune stone [Nastastenen, Nä34, L1981:9172, Rinkaby 5:1 i Örebro](https://runkartan.se/runristningar/runsten-nastastenen-na34-l1981-9172-rinkaby-5-1-i-orebro-orebro.html), which we had seen before, but Clara hadn't, since it is nicely on the way, and said to be the prettiest in Närke.

Then we went to Vadstena, had fika with Rebeccah, Keldor’s sister, and then out to see second hand stores, the castle, etc. Clara found a nice skirt at one, and a dressy jacket at another that fits her perfectly. Keldor bought a tiny cannon keychain at the castle, a basket we can use to pick mushrooms while out in the forest for the Archery shoot this weekend, and a sword, ok rapier foil (for only 15 kr!) I found a book on the history of Sweden from 13,000 BC to 600 AD, a oversize blue wool sweater (which I needed straight away, as we had taken Rebeccah's car to the local adventures, and I hadn't remembered to grab my wool sweater from our car. The castle is right on the lake, and the breeze is cold in October!

Eventually, we said goodbye to Rebeccah and continued our journey to Boar hunt, arriving at 19:20, thirty hours after leaving home.
We were assigned cabin number six, and we quicky made our beds, unloaded the car, and changed into garb before heading up to the main hall.

I managed to spend some time catching up with friends, but felt as tired as one might expect after more than a day of driving and adventures, so I found some room to do my yoga on the landing upstairs in the main building, chatted with a few more people, and went to bed at 23:30.
