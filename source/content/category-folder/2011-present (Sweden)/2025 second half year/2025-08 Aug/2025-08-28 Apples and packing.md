I did, in fact, go to bed at 19:00 last night. This resulted in my waking up around 01:00, and by 01:20 I realised that I wouldn't fall right bacl to sleep, so I got up to see what I could accomplish with the time.
Just over two hour later I had filled both Keldor’s and my old food dehydrators with slices of apple from his dad's tree, and was ready to go back to sleep for a short rest.
The apples dried happily during the day, so I turned off the dehydrator in the early evening,  before I finished packing my chest for this weekend's event.
They discourage driving all the way down to the larp village to keep from damaging the road, which is just a sandy path through the forest. Therefore Keldor choose to pack his garb in a backpack instead of his normal chest. I opted to pack my things into my small chest, the one that had bern made to fit into the trunk of David's car. Ever since we got the matching larger chests we have had one each for clothing, and used the small one for accessories. It was interesting to remember that the little chest uses to be enough,  and make it so, again.
