Didn't really want to get up this morning,  did it anyway. Had a good morning phone call with Keldor as he drove to work, then took my elsparkcyckel to the busstop. 

As expected, the 1.5 hour bus ride wasn't long enough to empty ny inbox from all the vacation mail, though I did manage to delete a fair bit.

I tried stopping by hörcentralen on the way to work, as my left hearing aid hasn't seemed to be producing sound at full power. However, they had a note on the door saying reduced drop-in hours right now due to someone being out on sick leave. I checked their normal open hours, and they don't open till 09:00 anyway, so I will need to try again another day.

Had both fika and lunch breaks with Phil. He says they have lots of red currants if I want to come pick some. I said I would love to, later in the week, as I have blueberries drying and black currants in the fridge.

This evening I took the dry blueberries out of the dehydrators, and consolidated the ones that are still moist onto two trays. Then I washed the black currants, and decided that it was too late to tey to dry them, so hust bagged them and put them in the freezer.
