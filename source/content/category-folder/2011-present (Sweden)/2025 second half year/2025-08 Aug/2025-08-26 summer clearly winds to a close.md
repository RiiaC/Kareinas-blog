I took my electric scooter over to the dentist today, and learned the hard way that it is too cold to be out with only a thin cashmere sweater as an outer layer if one is moving at 20 km/hr. Brrr.
Other accomplishments of the day include work, laundry, getting the dried black currants off of the old, kinda broken plastic trays they had stuck to, and ordering a new, larger, food dehydrator with stainless steel trays. It will be interesting to see how well it works.

I am also pleased that whatever caused the muscle aling the right side of my spine to hurt yesterday and this morning seems to have adjusted itself, as it is feeling much better.
