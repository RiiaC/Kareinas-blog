Today was a good work day as I started the day reading in the Obsidian discord channel and learned of a few things that will be useful later, and others that are already useful. This inspired me to start working on my proof of concept SEAD database structure Obsidian vault.

In the long run I want to be able to export the entire database structure and import it into Obsidian, with links between everything that is connected and properties for all of the import information attached to each type of data. 

But that is going to take time and lots of learning and experiments. So for today I have started a database structure vault that has a few folders for thing like Location, Sample, Analysis, etc, and put at least a couple notes under each, and created properties for links between them (as daughter or parent, so that the graph view connection lines show the arrows going in the same direction as in the pdf we have that shows the database structure). Then I applied colour coding to the folders so that each will have the same colour as in that pdf, and applied groups in the graph view based on the folders, with colour coding to match.

So far it is a tiny hint of the full database structure, but it is working exactly how I want it to.

So I sent a message to my colleague, Roger, who also uses Obsidian and showed him the photo, and he pointed out that to get the full structure I can use 
Visio, and provided a link. He also commented that he has been looking for a good way to graphically present the database structure, and agrees that Obsidian may be the tool to accomplish this.

But by then it was pretty much 13:00, and I needed to quit work for the day to åack for the event (a little early, but I have put in a few nine hour days to make this possible).  

I also needed to eat lunch, so by the time I finished packing bedding, projects, banners and food (clothes and archery stuff and the mattress were already in the can last night), had cleaned the kitchen and emptied the cat sand and trash, and fed the cats, it was already 16:00, and Keldor was already off work for the day and taking a nap at his dad's house.

So I picked up his package that arrived today (new arrow points, we'd packed the arrows waiting for points), and drove up to Skelleftehamn to pick him up.

Now we are heading to a store to get him a few last minute things, then we are on our way to Skördefest, a local SCA event at the larp village about half an hour north of Skellefteå.
