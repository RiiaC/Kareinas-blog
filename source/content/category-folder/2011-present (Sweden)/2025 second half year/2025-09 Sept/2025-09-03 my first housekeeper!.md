I payed someone to clean my house today, while I washed the cat water fountain, put away stuff, and packed for Glotta Gillet. Worth. Every. Penny!!! 

My bathroom hasn't been that well scrubbed on all surfaces in a very long time! And when their vacuum didn't pick up the cat hair on the carpet in the living room, he took the cat brush to it.
