My morning meeting was in "the bunker", where I got to see cool artefacts a retired archaeologist couple left in storage here without telling anyone. They need to go to a museum 

- picked up car from service
- cooked food for tomorrow 
- there were northern lights, so yoga got postponed enough to go have a look
