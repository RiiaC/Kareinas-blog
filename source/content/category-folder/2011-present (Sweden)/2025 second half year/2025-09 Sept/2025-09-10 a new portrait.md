Finally! Dark enough in the mornings that my dawn light has me already kinda waking before his 05:00 alarm. Makes mornings a little easier. 
Today I had an appointment to have a portrait taken, which the uni will have on file to use for any news or publicity that mentions me, and I am welcome to use it myself.
I made reasonable progress on my quest of finding locations on the bus in, and for a while at work. Then felt tired and went to catch the early bus home, making more good progress on the bus. And, after a short pause made even better progress at home.
