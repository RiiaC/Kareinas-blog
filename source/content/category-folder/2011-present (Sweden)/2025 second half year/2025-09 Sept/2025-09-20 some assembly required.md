Sister's zoom call this morning. Been a few weeks since I could join. Beth is looking for work. Anyone in the Seattle area know of openings in Customer Success in the tech industry? She hadn't mentioned to me a few years ago when she started taking steps to reduce her weight, so I was surprised when she and Amber sent photos from the formal dinner they went to the other day. A few years ago I was worried about her health (and didn't say anything to her) as her figure had gone beyond the extra weight that mom had, and started approaching Grandma's. Now she is wearing size medium clothes. She says she has dropped very slowly, and we only ever see one another in zoom calls, so neck up, so no surprise I hadn't noticed the change, but well done!

Kirsty has started doing strength training three days a week, in an attempt to increase bone density, and my, are her arms showing the effect!

Amber is slowly improving after surgery, but not as much/fast as we would like.

The two in the states are unwilling to discuss how things are there. They try to stay in their bubble and not see how bad it is, as there is enough stress in their personal lives between recovering and job searching etc. I understand, but i atill worry about them, their partners, neither of whom were born in the US, and my nices who have always been proud to be Latina.

This weekend was the local harvest market, over in the church village, so of course we walked over there. I bought a variety of fresh veg: broad beans, kale, silverbeet, zucchini, yellow zucchini, broccli, and a tiny pumpkin. He bought a bottle of shampoo with tar in it, because he loves the smell of tar (he also loves to eat the various Finnish foods containing tar), a some checked fabric that will make a nice pair of trousers for SCA, some cheese, fresh eggs, honey, and some moose sausage and some reindeer salami, both of which have 100% of their meat and fat from the animal in question,  which is unusual.  Most Swedish sausages contain meat and/or fat from pigs.

Then we walked the little bit further to the Second Hand store, which is rarely open, but usually for a matket weekend. They had a ceramic dark blue chamber pot that I couldn't resist buying as it will be nice at camping events not to have to leave the tent in the night when I need to pee. I also got a little dark blue ceramic dish sized nicely for a serving of nuts, and a tall dark blue stoneware pot with a lid, bought, in part because the lid also fits the chamber pot, and that might be nice to have.

After we got home I mixed up a small batch of pie dough,  cut up my veg and mixed it with spices and one of the eggs, filled a tray of pasties and popped them into the oven. The other halv of the veg was tossed into a pot with canned tomato, mushroom powder  and water, and, as soon as it was bouling nicely, some home made noodles. Yum!

I will take a couple pasties with me when I travel on Monday, the rest ate in the freezer for future roadtrips.

I wish I weren't travelling this coming week, I would have bought some beetroot to make beetloaf. But I knew I wouldn't have time this weekend, with Leif's party tomorrow. Last year I bought beets at the harvest market to do beetloaf, but didn't have time before they got squishy.

Then I took some measurements and started making a paper mockup of a box the chamber pot can live in, and determined that the wooden boxes from Jula that are so popular in the SCA because cheap, and easy to decorate are about the right size to transform into a box seat for the chamber pot.

This evening I cut out a sewing project from the blue silk I bought at Cudgel, and some purple silk I had bought at an event longer go. I considered the purple I had bought at Cudgel, but it is quite a bit thicker than the blue, while the one i have had longer is a better match for texture.

I am doing a short bilaut style tunic, parti-coloured, and with angel winged sleeves.
