I tried to visit Charlotte in the hospital on my way to work, but she was sleeping.

It was the first day of Academic Swedish course I had signed up for, and I didn't really feel I got much out of it. It seems that the 100 most frequently used words in Swedish academic writing are ones I am already familiar with.

I was super tired in the evening, and felt like I could go to bed at 19:00, but stayed up to see the Northern Lights. Even so, I finished yoga before 21:00, and went straight to bed after.
