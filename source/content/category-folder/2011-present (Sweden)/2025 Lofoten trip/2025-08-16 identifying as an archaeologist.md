Today was our last full day of working at the Viking Museum. Tomorrow we have a full shift, but we will spend much of the time packing stuff up.  To be fair, we have already started. Today's weather was kinda random, with scattered showers alternating with sunny moments, and a reasonable amount of wind. 

As a result of the latter two, the tent we had put over the old smithy was largely dry in the portion that wasn't in contact with the ground. Therefore, we moved my rock carving station to under the grass roof next to the outdoor smithy and unhooked the tent stakes so we could let the tent hang from its ridge pole into the smithy area and get a little head start on drying for a few hours. Then, at the end of our shift we moved it to hang the ridge pole from the wooden frame holding up the grass roof so that it can continue to dry overnight. 

Tomorrow we can fold it and stack everything we've been using on a pallet for Drift to drive up the hill and put it away.

After work we did a video call with the cat sitter and packed everything that isn't needed tomorrow and loaded it in the car.

The I did yoga and had a shower, so now I am ready to sleep.

Ps more than once while working here visitors have asked what I do when not here. I reply "I am an archaeologist working at Umeå University.  You know what, that feels really neat to say!
