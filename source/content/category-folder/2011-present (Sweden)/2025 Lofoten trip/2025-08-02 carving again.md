- woke 6:45 so I could join my sisters on our fortnightly zoom call. It has bern some weeks since we all four could attend one with one or more of us travelling lately (often me), so it was nice to catch up with them.
- I went back to sleep for another hour and a half after we spoke, then got up to do my morning pilates, have breakfast, and baked some naan bread to take with us today.
- we arrived just before out 12:00 start time, but couldn't log in at the café, as the tablet we use for that had re-started in the night, and no one knew the pin to wake it back up. So we set up our work stations and then one of the other workers mentioned there is another log-in tablet over at the boat house, so I walked down and clocked us both in for the day.
- carving progress for the day: got rid of the last of the ridge around the outside of the pot, and started working on the inside again. Had enough conversations with visitors that I didn't do so many hours of carving, but I probably need to adjust something in my work station as my back was sore by the end of the day. 
- highlight conversation of the day was a family from Colorado, with a teen, Oliver, who wants to go to university in Europe to study archaeology. I shared what I know of studying in Europe, and gave them my name to look me up on the Umeå University web page.
- after work I was too tired to even go to the store, so the evening was spent with yoga, relaxing on FB and updating my logs.
