# stenbro rastplats 
- We slept at the Stenbro (stone bridge) rest area, near the really huge Aitik Copper mine.
- Keldor found an old iron nail under the stone bridge, which will make a fablous 'trollkros'.

- My hips were aching after yesterday's drive, so I set my yoga app to the Pilates setting,  boosting glute strength, and did my workout on some sheeepskins under the bridge, in the shade, with a beautiful breeze flowing past. 100% recommended. Would do again.
