Thursday morning I woke motivated to finally start writing my blog post about making the cloak for the Drachenwald Order of the Mark, and made good progress on that before Keldor woke.
Then we had a leisurely breakfast and drove up to Svolvær because he wanted to visit the WWII museum. The war touched this area rather a lot, and there is a very impressive collection of artefacts they have gathered, filling five rooms. Uniforms, other clothing, epquipment, tools, weapons, documents, and quite a bit of amazing art that had been made by prisoners of war. I never remembered that I had a phone that could take photos, but the guy who made a pretty bone knife with a nice wood handle and a lovely braded belt made out of cellofan from cigarette wrappers as a gift for his young daughter did a beautiful job, and I hope she appreciated it. The guitar made of match sticks is amazing. 
Keldor did remember to take some photos, but most of them he will never share as this museum contains a lot of items that had belonged to folk on the German side of the war, and there are symbols on those uniforms, toys, etc. That one doesn't share. Ask him if you are curious. The Christmas tree was expecially overwhelming in the amout of efort the artists went to to make ornaments that would have been beautiful if not for the propaganda. 

Then he dropped me off at Sandra's house, and went fishing. I think I had the better evening entertainment hanging out talking and sharing stories with a friend, while he was out in the wind, occasionally putting fish he didn't want to keep back in the water (and not seeing any he wanted to keep), but he seemed to have enjoyed it anyway. 

Now we have three days left to work before we head home, and our shift has switched to the early one, 10:00 to 17:00, and it is already nearly 08:00, so I should get up and face my day.
