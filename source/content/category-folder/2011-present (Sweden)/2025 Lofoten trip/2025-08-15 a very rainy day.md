Woke at 07:00, wrote up and posted about yesterday before I forgot it, and did a quick pilates.

Today was the rainiest day since arriving in Lofoten, and we wondered as we set up our work stations for the day if we would have visitors who would take the walk down the hill in the rain, or if it would be a day of quiet solitude for us?

For the first hour it was, indeed, quiet, but then a few people arrived, and then gradually more, and more again, till the amount of time spent talking with visitors felt like a typical day here. Then it slowed down again as it neared the end of our shift and we packed things up for the walk up the hill.

The nice thing of getting off work at 17:00 now (as opposed to 18:00 or 19:00, which were the two shift end times we have had since arriving) is that I had energy to cook after work, and I made a small pot of chilli. Good thing, too. Keldor failed to eat any breakfast, and didn't eat any of the food we had brought with us, so his day's intake consisted of tea, coffee, and a can of Monster energy drink. Silly boy. He was rather hungry by the time the chili was ready.
